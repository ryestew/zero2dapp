# Participant Quick Guide

Welcome! This is your fast-lane overview for navigating the workshops, building your project, and submitting it for the $100 prize.

---

## 1. Getting Started

### Fork the Repo

Click **Fork** → clone your fork:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <repo>
npm install
```

---

## 2. How the Workshops Work

Each workshop session has a **final state branch** named after the protocol. In **The Graph workshop** we are setting up the whole project, so we have two branches. Please start form the-graph branch, if you are building!

```
- Remix (main)
- The Graph (the-graph) - get started branch
- The Graph (the-graph-solved) 
- Celo (celo)
- Chainlink (chainlink)
- ENS (ENS)
- Uniswap (UF)
- Self Protocol (Self)
```

You can start building from any branch depending on when you join. As the Remix workshop does not yet come with a ready project, we recommend starting off from `the-graph` branch!!

---

## ⏱️ 3. If You Join Late

* **Joined during first half of a session?**
  → Check out the **previous** session branch to follow the step-by-step build, except for The Graph workshop, there you should start with `the-graph` branch.

  ```bash
  git checkout <previous-protocol-name>
  ```

* **Joined during second half or later?**
  → Check out the **current** session’s final branch so you can jump right in.


  ```bash
  git checkout <current-protocol-name>
  ```

---

## 🛠️ 4. Build Your Project

Create a new branch in your fork:

```bash
git checkout -b my-project
```

Your goal:
**Integrate at least TWO workshop technologies** into a small project.
Even a tiny prototype is totally valid — we want everyone to submit.
